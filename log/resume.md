A vector graphics presentation app consisting of a canvas on which objects are
placed and a viewport through which the canvas is viewed. Both viewport and
objects are animatable between waypoints.

The app is written in a mix of Clojurescript and Javascript on the client, and
Clojure on the server. parse.com is used for storing state.

Some projects on my github were created for this app.

  Javascript, with pluggable selector implementation.

- [spaghetti](https://github.com/jedahu/spaghetti): simple state machine.

##### Server

- [ring-xslt](https://github.com/jedahu/ring-xslt): [ring][] middleware for
  transforming XML files using Saxon.

##### Tools
